## Midterm Assignment 
### Question 8: Using your choice of a geospatial API, create a web map that visualizes at least two datasets of your choice and includes an analysis component
#### Author: Kenzie McPhie 10-22-2025

This map includes two datasets: Wyoming State Park Locations and data from Air Quality Stations. The goal of this map was to determine if air quality is better around State Parks since the land is closely managed. 

The state park data is from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wyoming_state_parks>

The air quality station data is from <https://www.iqair.com/us/usa/wyoming>

The anticipated result was that there would be very little correlation. Wyoming has a lot of well managed, open land that does not lie within State Parks. In other, more urban areas, this analysis has been performed and there has been more correlation, though still slight. This analysis of Wyoming's parks was inspired by a reddit post found here: <https://www.reddit.com/r/answers/comments/1bs6g5k/does_new_york_rely_on_central_parks_nature_for/>

Whether privately owned or public, Wyoming's lands are well maintained and don't get a lot of traffic, so the air quality state wide is consistently good. In hindsight, it would have been more interesting to view airquality in areas that had recent wildfires this last season.
